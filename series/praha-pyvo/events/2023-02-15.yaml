talks:
- title: "The Bridge Between Sync and Async World"
  speakers:
    - Václav Košař

    Asyncio, a Python builtin library, provides advantages in heavy IO-bound use cases, but on the other hand, spreads complexity across the synchronous code base like weeds.
    This talk will give you a quick overview of the AsyncIO library and will demonstrate a utility class AsyncioThreadLoop that can isolate the async method calls from your synchronous code.

- title: "5 essentials to pack on your career climb"
  speakers:
    - Šárka Kousalová

    What are the five things to have always prepared to pass your interview successfully.


- title: "Why is lunch break a NP-complete problem"
  speakers:
    - Jan Urban
  description: |
    Join me for a thought-provoking discussion on the topic of lunch breaks and the challenges they pose in the workplace.
    This presentation will delve into the transformation of a simple problem written in law into an NP-complete problem, and explore the difficulties and trade-offs involved in finding a solution.
