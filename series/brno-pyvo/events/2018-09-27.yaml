  - title: Classifying Python Videos with a Graph Database
    description: |
        There are so many Python Videos on the web.
        How do we find the good free videos on the topics we are interested in,
        and avoid the junk?

        [PythonLinks.info](https://PythonLinks.info) organize Python-related videos
        into a tree of categories.
        It rates each video based on upvotes versus total votes.
        Swipe left, right, up, or down to browse the tree. 

        This talk discusses the Python Video Ecosystem, the classification approach,
        and the underlying Python Graph Database *(ZODB)*.
