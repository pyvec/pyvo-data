        Let's look at Python's annotations (a.k.a. type hints) from the language
        point of view: how Python handles them, rather than what they mean to
        type checkers like `mypy` or modelling tools like `dataclasses`
        or `pydantic`.

        We'll cover how it started (function annotations in 3.0, PEP 3107),
        how it's going (including variable annotations in 3.6, PEP 526),
        how we thought it would work (`__future__` annotations in 3.7, PEP 563),
        and how we now think it will work (deferred evaluation, in 3.14, PEP 649).
