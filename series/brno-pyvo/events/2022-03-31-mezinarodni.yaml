        Brief overview of why Python is a good choice for beginner programmers. Lesson on up-selling programming to those who are "bad" at math and logic.
        Finish with two languages that will be good precursors to python (for kids or those who really want a leg up).

        Brian as a natural STEM candidate, decided to go the hard route and develop my soft skills instead.
        Been working on my metaphors and storytelling skills since 2000's to be able to more effectively translate my first language "Algebra" into implicit English.
