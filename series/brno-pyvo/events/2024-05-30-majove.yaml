      There are approximately 4,000 Slovak songs, but where can they be found? Historically, these songs were shared through oral tradition.
      Interestingly, the fields of ethnology and musicoethnology emerged in Slovakia quite early, and early ethnologists began compiling
      known songs into collections called songbooks and hymnals to preserve them. Unfortunately, the format of these compilations has changed little
      over the past 200 years. It's time for a modern approach.

      Using FastAPI, Jinja2, Alembic, Bootstrap, and HTMX, I'm developing a website to gather all available songs in one place.
      The main features of this project include accessibility, easy search and filter options, and organized song collections.

      About me: I work as a quality engineer in Red Hat's Kernel Performance team, focusing on kernel virtual storage and file systems.
      For the past decade, Python has been my go-to tool for automating tasks like running tests and processing test results.
      Outside of work, I play a range of traditional instruments, including the violin, viola, bagpipes, and various traditional flutes,
      and perform with several folklore groups.
