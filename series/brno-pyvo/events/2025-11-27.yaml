        Python 3.14.0 is out, with a lot of improvements for you to use.
        I'll show off the most interesting new features, so you don't need to
        read the [What's New document](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html)
        yourself!

        And maybe we'll also meet an unpleasant bug that slipped through.
        Or maybe -- since it's almost December -- an easter egg?
