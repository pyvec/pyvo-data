talks:
    - title: What's New in Python 3.14
      speakers:
        - Petr Viktorin
      description: |
        Python 3.14.0 is out, with a lot of improvements for you to use.
        I'll show off the most interesting new features, so you don't need to
        read the [What's New document](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html)
        yourself!

        And maybe we'll also meet an unpleasant bug that slipped through.
        Or maybe -- since it's almost December -- an easter egg?
    - title: From Toxic Psychosis to Technical Director
      speakers:
        - Roman Viktor Dvořák
      description: |
        A talk about mental health, career struggles, burnout, and self-discovery. 
        A personal story of moving from a difficult start in life through finding 
        a new professional path, all the way to becoming a technical director 
        — and what you learn when life forces you to reboot.
        
        Roman is a freelance technical manager working across software, hardware, electronics, and mechanics.
