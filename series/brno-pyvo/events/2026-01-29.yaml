    První Pyvo v novém roce. Podíváme se na dizajn API a Polars, rychlou, škálovatelnou alternativu k Pandas.

    Poslední čtvrtek v měsíci v ArtBaru, jako obvykle.

    ---

    First Pyvo of the new year. We'll take a look at API design and Polars, fast and scalable alternative to Pandas.

    Last Thursday of the month at ArtBar, as usual.

talks:
    - title: How Beautiful APIs Come to Life
      speakers:
        - Ladislav Dobrovský

        Let's deep dive into popular APIs and see how the authors make them work. Expect to see some import magic,
        a LOT of decorators, chaining, proxy objects, and introspection.

        Ladislav Dobrovský works as researcher at CEITEC BUT with HPC systems and uses Python since 3.3 (2012). Likes also C++ and GPUs.
    - title: Are you working with a dataset so large that your notebook running Pandas starts to freeze?
      speakers:
        - Dalibor Trapl

        This talk is about modern alternatives for fast and scalable data analysis.
        Our main focus will be the Polars DataFrame library, which offers a dramatic speed improvement compared to Pandas.
        We will show when it pays off to use Polars instead of Pandas and discuss the key difference in approach: eager vs. lazy evaluation.
        We will briefly compare Polars with PySpark and I will share our experience integrating these technologies into our data pipelines.
        Learn how to speed up your data analysis and modernize your tech stack!

        Hi, I’m Dalibor. I moved from computational molecular simulation research to a Data Analyst role at Datamole during COVID lockdown.
        My daily work revolves around time-series analysis.
        I started out as a Pandas power user and have been adopting the latest tools in the Python data stack in recent years.
