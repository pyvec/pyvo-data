talks:
  - title: Combining Django ORM & FastAPI
    speakers:
      - Mia Bajiƒá
    description: |
      Django is the most extensive Python framework, which is also very opinionated and synchronous.
      In contrast, FastAPI emerges as a more recent, asynchronous framework.

      As a developer and the maintainer of several services, one of which is a data visualization tool
      deployed in production across various companies, I have had the unique opportunity to use Django ORM with FastAPI.
      If you take a look through GitHub or other resources, you‚Äôll notice there‚Äôs not much out there
      about combining Django and FastAPI ‚Äî it‚Äôs a bit of an unconventional setup. 
      The aim of my talk is to share insights from my experience with this setup, highlighting its practical
      implementation and the lessons learned along the way.

      This talk is aimed at programmers from beginners to more experienced ones familiar with either of these frameworks.
      You‚Äôll gain insights into combining asynchronous frameworks with synchronous ones,
      along with understanding the benefits and challenges of this approach.

      About Mia:
      I'm a software engineer based in Prague, Czech Republic with seven years of experience in the IT industry.
      I currently work at Ataccama, where I contribute to the development of a business intelligence tool and I maintain several AI microservices.
      I'm passionate about building tech communities and knowledge sharing.
      I'm the main organizer of Prague Python meetups & Prague Python Pizza and a co-organizer of PyCon CZ & EuroPython.
  - title: How to simplify feature delivery with effective API design
    speakers:
      - Michal Cyprian
    description: |
      In today's fast-paced world, the ability to deliver new features quickly is crucial for product-oriented companies.
      In this talk, we'll dive into architectural patterns that optimize the delivery of multiple client implementations
      in complex client-server architectures.

      The advent of the mobile age has dramatically altered the landscape of typical client-server models.
      After contending with these challenges, we've implemented architectural patterns known as Backend for Frontend (BFF) and Server-driven UI in Python.
      These patterns have brought significant advantages, but we're also aware of their limitations.
      We'll explore Python optimizations, caching strategies, and SQLAlchemy preloading techniques, which were crucial to our success.

      This talk aims to provide you with an overview of useful architectural patterns, insights on how to implement and optimize them in Python,
      and strategies to make your product managers happy by shortening your time to production.

      About Michal:
      I am a passionate software engineer who is always looking for new ways to solve complex business problems using the latest technologies.
      I enjoy sharing my knowledge and expertise with other engineers. I am also interested in leadership and creating a positive team culture.
      I strive to combine my technical skills with effective leadership skills to help individuals reach their full potential.
