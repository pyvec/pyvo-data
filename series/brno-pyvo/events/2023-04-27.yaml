      Join us for a hands-on introduction to Keras in a live Jupyter Notebook by Jiri Podivin.

      This interactive session will provide attendees with practical insights into building, training, and evaluating deep learning models using the popular Keras library.
      Through real-time examples, Jiri will guide you in understanding the power and simplicity of this high-level neural networks API.
      You can follow the demonstration on your laptop but it is not necessary for the meetup at all.
