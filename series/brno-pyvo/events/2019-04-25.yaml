    In april pyvo we will discuss tools making the work with microservice architecture easier for teams.


talks:
  - title: Don't talk, scheme! - Make service integration easier with schemata
    description: |
        Services (Micro or SOA) often introduce misunderstandings between teams and parties.
        During development, there's always room for change and improvement - things are flexible.
        This can be problematic with several teams and several services in parallel.

        Bind them with schema. Enforce the schema programmatically and use it to test. Reuse internal
        standards through your ecosystem, without consistency issues on your dependents.

        Examples are in Python: implementation and demonstration of some principles, and how they integrate.
