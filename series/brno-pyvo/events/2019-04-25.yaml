    In april pyvo we will discuss tools making the work with microservice architecture easier for teams.


talks:
  - title: Don't talk things, code things - Make service integration easier with schemata and modules
    description: |
        Services (Micro or SOA) in a way that includes least misunderstandings between teams and parties.
        During development, there's always a problem of communication and planning - especially in rapidly
        changing environments. Build several services parallely, each of them independent to a point,
        but bound with schema. Enforce the schema programmatically and use it to test.
        Reuse standards of the industry through your ecosystem, without consistency issues on your dependants.

        Examples are in Python: implementation and demonstration of some principles, and why they make things simpler.
