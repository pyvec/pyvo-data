talks:
    - title: Recursion vs iteration in Python
      speakers:
        - Juraj Paluba
      description: |
        At school, I was taught to prefer an iterative paradigm over the recursive one.
        The reasoning was that recursion is memory ineffective and thus does not scale well.
        Recently, I have come across a recursive implementation in the production code,
        but I was unable to reason why we should avoid it.

        Hence, I decided to investigate deeper and answer the question: "Is it okay to use recursion in a production-level code?".
        Together, we will cover the results from profiling specific recursive and iterative implementations.
        We will compare differences and analyze them.

        About the speaker:

        Hi, I am Juraj Paluba. I have studied computer science at Masaryk University.
        Besides that I have been professionally working as a (mainly Python) backend developer.
        I have gained experience working on a small university project (KYPO cyber-range platform),
        SAP system and lately as a freelancer in Datamole.
