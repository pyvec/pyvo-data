  The good thing about February being so short is that we can meet sooner at ArtBar for some great Pyvo meetup!

  We aim to start the talk shortly after 7PM.

  After the talk we smoothly transition into a sustainable eco-networking while sipping on our favourite beverages.

  The talk will be in English.

        In this talk, we will provide a practical example that covers the most common parts of a Micropython IoT project,
        including WiFi, web server/client, and async/await.
