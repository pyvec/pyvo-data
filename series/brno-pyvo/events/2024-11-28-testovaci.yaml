        Would you like to work with a codebase you are not afraid to touch?

        A codebase that is easy to refactor because you have so many unit tests
        that immediately tell you when you do something wrong?

        A codebase that contains zero known defects?

        I am going to tell you a story of a team that lives like that,
        because their unit test coverage is over 96% and growing.

        The magic ingredient is Test-Driven Development (TDD) - writing tests together
        with the code in micro-increments taking no more than a couple of minutes.
        I will show you what TDD is (actual coding included) and how is it applied in the mentioned team
        to a python/django tech stack.
        I will talk about real-world experiences, benefits that TDD brings and the current challenges.
