        Some APIs are a delight to work with, while others are a frustrating challenge.

        In this talk, we will explore APIs for OpenAI’s large language models and Meta’s WhatsApp platform.

        We’ll then build a hands-on Python project that leverages these APIs alongside FastAPI and the requests library.

        Along the way, you’ll see that an HTTPS-enabled web server is required.

        This prompts us to experiment with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Certbot, making a truly comprehensive DevOps journey.
